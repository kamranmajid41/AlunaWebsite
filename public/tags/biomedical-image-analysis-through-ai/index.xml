      <description>&amp;ldquo;We develop an algorithm that can detect malaria from images of segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images with 96% accuracy. Our algorithm, SimpNet-7, is a 7-layer convolutional neural network trained on the NIH Malaria dataset, containing 27,588 images of parasitized and uninfected cells. We find that SimpNet-7 achieves an F1 score of 0.955, a precision of 0.946, and a recall of 0.974. We then propose the application of this algorithm in hospitals in areas where malaria is prominent but medical resources are sparse, such as African countries.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Laplace Operator on the Performance of CoronaNet for COVID-19 Detection</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the cause of a global pandemic that is affecting millions of people around the world. Inadequate testing resources have resulted in several people going undiagnosed and consequently untreated. However, using computerized tomography (CT) scans for diagnosis is an alternative to bypass this limitation. In this paper, we describe CoronaNet, a deep convolutional neural network that can recognize if a patient has COVID-19 from images of CT scans with 91% accuracy.</description>

      <title>CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We develop an algorithm that can detect pneumonia from chest X-rays at a level exceeding practicing radiologists. Our algorithm, CheXNet, is a 121-layer convolutional neural network trained on ChestX-ray14, currently the largest publicly available chest X-ray dataset, containing over 100,000 frontal-view X-ray images with 14 diseases. Four practicing academic radiologists annotate a test set, on which we compare the performance of CheXNet to that of radiologists. We find that CheXNet exceeds average radiologist performance on the F1 metric.</description>

      <title>Deep Segmentation Networks Predict Survival of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 80â€“85% of lung cancer diagnoses and is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent studies indicate that image-based radiomics features from positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images have predictive power for NSCLC outcomes. To this end, easily calculated functional features such as the maximum and the mean of standard uptake value (SUV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) are most commonly used for NSCLC prognostication, but their prognostic value remains controversial.</description>

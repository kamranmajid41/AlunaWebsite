      <description>&amp;ldquo;We develop an algorithm that can detect malaria from images of segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images with 96% accuracy. Our algorithm, SimpNet-7, is a 7-layer convolutional neural network trained on the NIH Malaria dataset, containing 27,588 images of parasitized and uninfected cells. We find that SimpNet-7 achieves an F1 score of 0.955, a precision of 0.946, and a recall of 0.974. We then propose the application of this algorithm in hospitals in areas where malaria is prominent but medical resources are sparse, such as African countries.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Laplace Operator on the Performance of CoronaNet for COVID-19 Detection</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the cause of a global pandemic that is affecting millions of people around the world. Inadequate testing resources have resulted in several people going undiagnosed and consequently untreated. However, using computerized tomography (CT) scans for diagnosis is an alternative to bypass this limitation. In this paper, we describe CoronaNet, a deep convolutional neural network that can recognize if a patient has COVID-19 from images of CT scans with 91% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Approach to Control of Prosthetic Hands With Electromyography Signals</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Natural muscles provide mobility in response to nerve impulses. Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles in response to a nerve&amp;rsquo;s stimulation. In the past few decades, EMG signals have been used extensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic devices. In the design of conventional assistive devices, developers optimize multiple subsystems independently. Feature extraction and feature description are essential subsystems of this approach.</description>

      <title>A Fast Machine Learning Model for ECG-Based Heartbeat Classification and Arrhythmia Detection</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We present a fully automatic and fast ECG arrhythmia classifier based on a simple brain-inspired machine learning approach known as Echo State Networks. Our classifier has a low-demanding feature processing that only requires a single ECG lead. Its training and validation follows an inter-patient procedure. Our approach is compatible with an online classification that aligns well with recent advances in health-monitoring wireless devices and wearables. The use of a combination of ensembles allows us to exploit parallelism to train the classifier with remarkable speeds.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence With Multi-Functional Machine Learning Platform Development for Better Healthcare and Precision Medicine</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Precision medicine is one of the recent and powerful developments in medical care, which has the potential to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, allowing earlier interventions using advanced diagnostics and tailoring better and economically personalized treatments. Identifying the best pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Accurate Deep Learning with Electronic Health Records</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Predictive modeling with electronic health record (EHR) data is anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve healthcare quality. Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient’s record. We propose a representation of patients’ entire raw EHR records based on the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format. We demonstrate that deep learning methods using this representation are capable of accurately predicting multiple medical events from multiple centers without site-specific data harmonization.</description>

      <title>CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We develop an algorithm that can detect pneumonia from chest X-rays at a level exceeding practicing radiologists. Our algorithm, CheXNet, is a 121-layer convolutional neural network trained on ChestX-ray14, currently the largest publicly available chest X-ray dataset, containing over 100,000 frontal-view X-ray images with 14 diseases. Four practicing academic radiologists annotate a test set, on which we compare the performance of CheXNet to that of radiologists. We find that CheXNet exceeds average radiologist performance on the F1 metric.</description>

      <title>Deep Segmentation Networks Predict Survival of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 80–85% of lung cancer diagnoses and is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recent studies indicate that image-based radiomics features from positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images have predictive power for NSCLC outcomes. To this end, easily calculated functional features such as the maximum and the mean of standard uptake value (SUV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) are most commonly used for NSCLC prognostication, but their prognostic value remains controversial.</description>
